## Security

### Data Classification

| Level | Data Types | Security Measures |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| Highly Sensitive | Financial Data, Tax IDs | Field-level encryption, strict access controls |
| Sensitive | Contact Details, Communications | Data masking, role-based access |
| Internal | Client Preferences, Notes | Standard access controls |
| Public | Client Name, Industry | Basic validation |

### Security Implementation

- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- JWT authentication with MFA support
- RBAC with attribute-based policies
- 90-day encryption key rotation
- Redis-based session management (30-minute timeout)
