  - `develop`: Integration branch for features
- Feature Branches:
  - Format: `feature/<feature-name>`
  - Example: `feature/candidate-matching`
- Bug Fix Branches:
  - Format: `bugfix/<bug-description>`
  - Example: `bugfix/login-validation`
- Release Branches:
  - Format: `release/<version>`
  - Example: `release/1.2.0`
- Hotfix Branches:
  - Format: `hotfix/<issue-description>`
  - Example: `hotfix/security-patch`

### Commit Conventions
